# Chapter 1 - About the project:
IODS is a great course where one can learn a lot of useful things. It seemed difficult at first glance, but
after spending some time and doing some research, one can certainly learn a lot and for me, the course has in a way, molded my perspective on data science.



The course is all about exploring the possibilities of ODS and getting familiar with those, as well as having fun.
